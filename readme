## Run Locally

Step-1: Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Adi-The-Pro/CouchCriticDeployment
  cd CouchCriticDeployment
```

Step 2: Create Your MongoDB Account and Database Cluster
- Create your own MongoDB account by visiting the MongoDB website and signing up for a new account.
- Create a new database or cluster by following the instructions provided in the MongoDB documentation. Remember to note down the "Connect to your application URI" for the database, as you will need it later. Also, make sure to change <password> with your own password
- Add your current IP address to the MongoDB database's IP whitelist to allow connections (this is needed whenever your ip changes)

Step 3: Edit the Environment File
- Check a file named .env in the /backend directory.
- This file will store environment variables for the project to run.

Step 4: Update MongoDB URI
- In the .env file, find the line that reads:
- MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-uri"
- Replace "your-mongodb-uri" with the actual URI of your MongoDB database.

Step 5: Install Backend And Frontend Dependencies
- In your terminal, navigate to the /backend directory and /myapp directory
```bash
  npm install
```

Step 6: Run the Backend Server
- In the same terminal, run the following command to start the backend server:
```bash
  npm run dev
```

Step 7: Run the Frontend Server
- After installing the frontend dependencies, run the following command in the same terminal to start the frontend server:
```bash
  npm run dev
```
